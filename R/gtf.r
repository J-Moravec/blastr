#' Read gtf file
#'
#' Read the gtf file and optionally parse attributes.
#'
#' The GTF2.2 file format is an extension of the older GFF file format with additional
#' information. Typically, GTF2.2 has 9 tab-separated columns: chromosome, source, feature,
#' start, end, score, strand, frame, and the attribute column. The attribute column is optional,
#' but in practice almost always present (at least the author of this comment have not seen
#' a gtf file without it).
#'
#' If the `attributes = TRUE`, the attribute field is parsed and the attribute column removed.
#' Currently, parsing attributes is performed fully in R and is rather slow, filtering by
#' feature and caching is recommended. The field consist of semicolon-separated fields,
#' their number can vary depending on the available annotation information.
#' The field themselves consist of two space-separated elements, first one defines
#' the name of the field with the second being a double-quoted value, and there can be
#' multiple fields with the same name.
#'
#' The `parse_attributes()` function parses these fields, creating a `data.frame` with
#' all shared fields, if multiple fields share the same name, they are merged using semicolon.
#'
#' @param x For `read_gtf()` A file in the gtf2 format, for `parse_attributes()` the attribute
#' column see details
#' @param feature Filter the gtf file according to a feature of interest, such as gene, CDS,
#' or exon. For instance, if you are interested in proteins, they are typically carried by the
#' CDS feature.
#' @param attributes Parse attributes using the `parse_attributes() function, note that this
#' might take a substantial time.
#' @return For `read_gtf()` a data.frame with a parsed content of the gtf file with
#' the number of rows equal to the number of annotated lines in the gtf file, excluding comments.
#' If `attributes = FALSE`, the `data.frame` will contain exactly 9 columns (see details).
#' If `attributes = TRUE`, the number of columns varies depending on the annotation,
#' see details.
#' For `parse_attributes()`, a data.frame with parsed attributes with the number of rows
#' equivalent to the length of the input vector.
